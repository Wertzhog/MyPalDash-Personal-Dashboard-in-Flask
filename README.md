# MyPalDash - personal dashboard written in Flask

I challenged myself to create something usefull and refresh my Flask and Jinja2 skills alog the way.

This repo represents my effort  to create personal calorie tracker, with ability to track my macro nutrients on daily interval.Also I wanted to track my exercises and be able have basic shopping and TODO list functionality. All with a goal of improving my selfcare.

This is repo represents work in progress and is designed to be hosted on Raspberry Pi for personal home use(still needs more work on security and user management).
